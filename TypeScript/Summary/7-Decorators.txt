Decorators


- Decorators are often used in frameworks (eg Angular, Vue)
 to chance and enhance classes and how they behave.

- We can apply decorators on 
classes, properties, methods, parameters, and accessors (getters and setters).

- A decorator is just a function that gets called by the JavaScript runtime.
 In that function, we have a chance to modify a class and its members.

- To use decorators, we have to enable the experimentalDecorators setting in tsconfig.
 We can apply more than one decorator to a class or its members.
  Multiple decorators are applied in the reverse order.
