Type-script: JavaScript with type Checking. (same as static typing languages)
so anything we can do wtih JavaScript we can do it with Type_script.


Benefits:
- Static typing
- code completion
- refactoring
- shorthand notations

Drawbacks:
- completion:
(step is always involved coz browsers can't understand Type_script code) => transpilation
- discbline in coding


JavaScript => Simple Projects
Type_script => Medium to Large Projects


Terms
Dynamically-typed Languages IntelliSense
Refactoring
Source maps
Statically-typed Languages Transpiling
Type safety


Summary

- Programming languages divide into two categories: statically-typed and dynamically- typed.

- In statically-typed languages (eg C++, C#, Java, etc),
 the type of variables is set at compile-time and cannot change later.

-In dynamically-typed languages (eg Python, JavaScript, Ruby),
 the type of variables is determined at run-time and can change later.

-TypeScript is essentially JavaScript with static typing and some additional features
 that help us write more concise and robust code.

- Most IDEs and code editors supporting TypeScript provide incredible IntelliSense and auto-completion.
 So we get active hints as we code. A great productivity booster!

- By providing type information in our code,
 we get better refactoring support in most IDEs and code editors.

- Refactoring means changing the structure of the code without changing its behavior.
With TypeScript we can catch more bugs at compile time.

-Browsers don’t understand TypeScript code.So we need to use the TypeScript compiler
 to compile and translate (or transpile) our TypeScript code into 
 regular JavaScript for execution by browsers.

-Source maps are files that represent the mapping between
 TypeScript and JavaScript code. They’re used for debugging.

-We can configure the TypeScript compiler by enabling/disabling
 various settings in tsconfig.json.


create configure file for typescript compiler:
tsc --init 

after change the settings
tsc (to applay it)


to debug our code:
1- we uncommit "sourceMap" option
2- add breake point where we want to debug
3- Go to Run and debug
4- create a launch.json (choose node)
5- we add this option
"preLaunchTask": "tsc: build - tsconfig.json",




Install Type_script:
1- nodejs.org 
2- npm i -g typescript  
(i => install, -g installing globally)
3- tsc -v (check version)
(tsc =>  Type Script Compiler)
