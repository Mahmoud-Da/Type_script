Modules
Summary

- We use modules to organize our code across multiple files.

- Objects defined in a module are private and invisible to other modules unless exported.

- We use export and import statements to export and import objects from various modules.
 These statements are part of the ES6 module format.

- Over years, many module formats have been developed for JavaScript. 
 Examples are CommonJS (introduced by Node), AMD, UMD, etc.

- We can use the module setting in tsconfig to specify the module format
 the compiler should use when emitting JavaScript code.
